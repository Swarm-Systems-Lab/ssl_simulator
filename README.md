# Swarm Systems Lab Python Simulator

## Installation

You can install the ```ssl_simulator``` package directly from GitHub.

> The ```ssl_simulator``` package provides a stable, tested set of dependencies for the following packages: ```numpy```, ```matplotlib```, ```tqdm```, ```pandas```, ```scipy```, ```ipython```. We do not recommend modifying the version ranges, as the package has been tested to work with this specific combination.

Option 1. Install the latest **development version**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Swarm-Systems-Lab/ssl_simulator.git@master
```
Or, add it to your ```requierements.txt```:
```txt
git+https://github.com/Swarm-Systems-Lab/ssl_simulator.git@master
```
Option 2. Install a specific **stable release**

To use a stable version instead of the latest development code, replace ```@master``` with a release tag, e.g.:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Swarm-Systems-Lab/ssl_simulator.git@v0.0.1
```
Or in ```requierements.txt```:
```txt
git+https://github.com/Swarm-Systems-Lab/ssl_simulator.git@v0.0.1
```

Option 3. Editable **local install** for development
   
If you cloned the repository locally and want changes to the code to be immediately reflected without reinstalling:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Swarm-Systems-Lab/ssl_simulator.git
cd ssl_simulator
pip install -e .
```
